"Geriausias dalykas ceremonijoje yra Celine..Celine dainavimas kaip kulminacija buvo nuostabus, ašaros akyse ji atliko Edita Piaf dainą -Édith Piaf - L'hymne à l'amour tai ne olimpinės žaidynės, o LGBT propaganda kažkada tai buvo visai šeimai skirtas atidarymas, kurį mums patiko žiūrėti su mažais vaikais kaip šeima. tyčiojasi iš krikščionybės..Lietus ar šviesa, jokių nuobodžių akimirkų, pagarba organizatoriams…Svarbiausia per lietų dainavo , nešė deglą , o ponai sedejo po stogu ložese , taip neteisinga....nepagarba atlikejams  olimpinių žaidynių atidarymo ceremonijoje man patiko kažkas labiau nei bet kas kitas, tai buvo populiarioji dvasia, kuri buvo įkvėpta kaip geriausia Prancūzijos revoliucijos dvasia. Ne ceremonija, uždara privilegijuotiems ir turtingiems žmonėms, o visiems atvira ceremonija, kurią galima stebėti ir nuo namų stogų, nuo upės krantų. Paryžiaus turtai ir grožis buvo puiki vieta tokiai ceremonijai. Ne kiekvienas pasaulio miestas gali sau leisti tokią prabangą.","@yourife","2024-07-28T09:37:24Z","1"

Not a ceremony closed to the privileged and wealthy of the people, but a ceremony open to everyone where you can also watch from the roofs of the houses, from the banks of the river<br>The wealth and beauty of Paris was the perfect setting for such a ceremony.

"One of the critics of the opening ceremony, Fox News journalist Kyle Becker, saw in one of the performances a &quot;pale horse&quot; - a harbinger of the apocalypse, according to the Revelation of John the Evangelist:<br><br>And I looked, and behold, a pale horse: and his rider&#39;s name was &quot;death&quot;; and hell followed with him: and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with pestilence, and by the beasts of the earth - all these things may be upon the earth. maybe not because of Satan and the mythical forces of evil, but because of the people themselves, if the majority becomes like the majority of the people of the Russian Federation, not to see evil (indifference) and help to create it (participation in war, propaganda (formation of false opinion). It is up to the people to decide what will happen. do not shift responsibility to mythical characters for the evil that is happening on this beautiful, but human-tortured planet. everyone makes a choice themselves / to be part of evil or good. not to notice evil in a place and be an accomplice to it or to see and fight, not to let evil happen through you in any form. there are millions of types of evil on this planet. all this is generated by man and he can stop it all","@Morningstar_19","2024-07-28T01:47:28Z","2"

"Why are the comments so negative? Just because it was something we&#39;ve never seen before? Why is everyone so afraid of the unknown? This was pure art, and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise... Art is something you can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t judge, under any circumstance. If you don&#39;t like it, thats fine. But being hatefull is not gonna change anything. Did you all felt better after writing that comments? Does your low self-esteem get any higher? <br>Why can&#39;t people just accept that the world is moving, changing, evolving... Isn&#39;t it boring to live with such a strict attitude? Isn&#39;t it boring to be so negative? Isn&#39;t it boring to be so narrow-minded?","@momotabita","2024-07-27T23:19:35Z","1"

It is very close to my heart since I was a child, something sacred even and I would die to be a part of Olympics in some shape or form, but this was disgusting. Beating into one&#39;s head political agendas on the most important sporting event sickens me to my deepest core. All previous opening ceremonies were about culture, pride of nation&#39;s history and most of all SPORT. Here it seemed more like some sort of political gathering, rather than olympics. There was NOTHING that could resemble sporting event. And what about those participating? How must they feel? Someone might disagree with those political views beat upon all of us but somehow they have to participate, because how can you not if you spent your whole life pursuing a goal of performing at Olympic Games. I feel sick when I look at it and once again it disgusts me deeply.","@pucek365","2024-07-27T20:32:18Z","1"

I am so overwhelmed with this, every show is overloaded with this (Eurovision, The Olympic Games).<br>You compare lgbt people with saints and God like on the painting of Da Vinci...

"Я в восторге. По-моему, идея, когда река - сцена, а декорация - сам город, очень удачная. Командам вместо обычного утомительного похода предложена весёлая речная прогулка. Публика свободна от всяких металлоискателей, безопасность обеспечивает естественный барьер - река. И речной транспорт уже был, ничего не надо строить специально для Олимпиады, очень разумно и экономно. А многоцветье костюмов на фоне камня, а подиум с разнообразной публикой - просто великолепны. С наступлением темноты - ещё лучше. Франция показала себя самой свободной и самой талантливой страной. Браво!","@indrik617","2024-07-27T16:50:47Z","7"

"&#39;&#39;Olympics&#39;&#39; is a torch carried through hundreds of years. It is humanity at its best ! Uniting the World with sports games &amp; competitions representing a healthy way of life in the most positive light. It was extremely disappointing to watch the opening ceremony with a direction so far away from artistic, intelligent &amp; elegant style. At the very beginning when the torch was on train carried by a man we are suddenly diverted to a very different story, which became highly political &amp; provocative. Children meeting a ghost on a boat taken to underground skulls to face death,.....rest I don&#39;t want to mention but just say etc....Olympics is not &amp; never should be used as a platform for expressing any kind of personal choice. It is a platform of international sports competition. Opening ceremony in my opinion did not look professional ,it looked like a very low budget show that is rushed in a very short time with no effort.I don&#39;t think &#39;&#39;Thomas Jolly&#39;&#39; really does understand the context of &#39;&#39;Olympics&#39;&#39; ... I want to watch &#39;&#39;Olympics Opening&#39;&#39; not &#39;&#39;Thomas Jolly&#39;&#39; attitude &amp; personal approach to life. It was a very low taste amateur performance at many levels. No style, no grace which must be &#39;&#39;Olympics&#39;&#39; motto at highest level.Sad!!!","@denizmoules7533","2024-07-27T12:15:26Z","4"

"Thnaks, Eurosport, for the chance to see the opening ceremony! I personally really wanted to like it, but no, I didn&#39;t. And, no, not because of all the gender/gay of whatever related scenes. But I just didn&#39;t find it captivating enough, interesting or really creative. Boring costumes and choreography, boring boat parade, boring and unnecessary video-clips (and cringy mignons), simple light show (nothing even close to Sydney Vivid, for example)... Just general feeling of half-assed work and whatever attitude. Steel horse and Celion Dion were amazing though. Still, good luck for all athletes!","@katerina1983","2024-07-27T08:27:11Z","0"

"The more ignorant you are, the more you are talking about what you have provided in your commentary brief. Could we have plese at least one opening ceremony without talking over artistic part? I know what I see and if one is not able to see it, your talking is nothing close to audio description? What is the point of talking then? What is the point of talking that there will be Celin Dion half an hour before she appeard? How did you thought, that 50 year old guy is the older living French olympics?<br>Just another great opening ceremony after London, that we couldn&#39;t fully enjoy because of unprepared, but over ambitious comentators.","@karfrancouzsky9725","2024-07-26T21:58:35Z","0"

"Easily worst opening of a major sport event in the last 30 years. Second worst was Euro2016.. in France. Somehow since 1998 this country turned into artistic cesspit.","@maxmach4361","2024-07-26T21:54:54Z","15"

"Ово отварање је једно од спектакуларно најгорих и најодвратнијих отварања олимпијских игара икада! Конфузно и саблазно, без икаквог реда и поретка као и цепање стадиона што је симбол круга... <br>Господе Исусе Христе Сине и Речи Божија, имај милости за свој свет!","@nadjaleoneed5164","2024-07-26T21:49:44Z","22"
